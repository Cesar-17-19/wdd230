            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The website is called San Pedro Chamber of Commerce, I gave it this name because in the city where I live
                San
                Pedro is the name of an important and historical site and I thought it was appropriate because it
                represents
                that.</p>
