            <h2>Acts 27:21-24</h2>
            <p>21 But after long abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have
                hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.
                <br>
                22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of any man's alife among you,
                but of the ship.
                <br>
                23 For there stood by me this night the aangel of God, whose I am, and whom I serve,
                <br>
                24 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before CÃ¦sar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that
                sail with thee.

            <h2>Song Of Solomon 4:1-3</h2>
            <p>1 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair
                is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.
                <br>
                2 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every
                one bear twins, and none is barren among them.
                <br>
                3 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a
                pomegranate within thy locks.
